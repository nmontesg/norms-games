``norms-games`` documentation
=============================

Introduction
------------

**norms-games** implements a computational model of Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework. It includes the interpreter of the Action Situation Language (ASL) and the game engine to automatically generate extensive-form games from ASL descriptions.


Requirements
------------

``norms-games`` requires a working installation of the following:

- Python 3
- `SWI-Prolog <https://www.swi-prolog.org/>`_
- The `PySwip <https://github.com/yuce/pyswip>`_ package


Usage
-----

For the time being, the ``norms-games`` package requires to download a local copy of the source code (using ``git clone``). The path to the package should then `be appended to your Python path <https://www.johnny-lin.com/cdat_tips/tips_pylang/path.html>`_.

The ``examples`` directories has some illustrations on how to use the basic functions. Basically, you should create your ASL description in three distinct files:

- ``agents.pl``
- ``states.pl``
- ``rules.pl``

Then, to construct the extensive-form game semantics of your description, it is enough to call:

>>> build_full_game(<path_to_ASL_description>, <identifier>, (threshold=..., max_rounds=...))

See the documentation for further details.
