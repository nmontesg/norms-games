# Games from Rules

This app demonstrates how to model a situation as an Extensive Form Game from the specification of the rules that structure it.

A game is built from three information sources:

1. ``agents``: what agents are there susceptible of entering the situation, plus any additional attributes.
              
2. ``rules``: the rules (of different types) structuring the situation.
              
3. ``states``: initial and termination conditions, plus some auxiliary information.
