# A Computational Model of the IAD framework

This repository implements a computational model of Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework [1]. It includes the interpreter to the Action Situation Language (ASL) and the game engine to automatically generate extensive-form games from ASL descriptions.

## Requirements

_norms-games_ requires a working installation of the following:
* Python 3
* [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)
* [PySwip package](https://github.com/yuce/pyswip)

## Usage

For the time being, the ``norms-games`` package requires to download a local copy of the source code (using ``git clone``). The path to the package should then [be appended to your Python path](https://www.johnny-lin.com/cdat_tips/tips_pylang/path.html).

The ``examples`` directories has some illustrations on how to use the basic functions. Basically, you should create your ASL description in three distinct files:

- ``agents.pl``
- ``states.pl``
- ``rules.pl``

Then, to construct the extensive-form game semantics of your description, it is enough to call:

    build_full_game(<path_to_ASL_description>, <identifier>, (threshold=..., max_rounds=...))

See the documentation for further details.
