# Integration of norms and game theory

This repository implements a computational model of Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework. It defines the syntax of the Action Situation Language (ASL) and includes the game engine to generate a formal model (an extensive-form game) from an input action situation description.

**Note:** _norms-games_ requires a working installation of [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and the [PySwip package](https://github.com/yuce/pyswip).
